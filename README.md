# Gender-recognition
A gender recognizing project based on PCA and BP neural network, using MATLAB as the environment for programing.
## The workflow of gender-recognization

## Feature extraction using fastPCA
I used PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the intitial characteristic from 10304 to 60, i.e. using 60 numbers to represent features of the samples. Below is an image of 60 eigenfaces.

## Train neural network
A four-layer neural network is adopted to do the gender-classification. This is an image of its structure.

## GUI for human-computer interraction

A simple GUI is designed using App Desinger whithin MATLAB. This is a picture illustrating how it works.
